# Hyperspectral Change-Detection-based-on-modification-of-UNet-neural-networks
## Introduction
### Abstract. The Earthâ€™s surface changes continuously due to several natural and humanmade
### factors. Efficient change detection (CD) is useful in monitoring and managing different situations. The recent rise in launched hyperspectral platforms provides a diversity of spectrum in
### addition to the spatial resolution required to meet recent civil application requirements.
### Traditional multispectral CD algorithms hardly cope with the complex nature of hyperspectral
### images and their high dimensionality. To overcome these limitations, a CD deep convolutional
### neural network (CNN) semantic segmentation-based workflow was proposed. The proposed
### workflow is composed of four main stages, namely preprocessing, training, testing, and evaluation

# Dataset: 
## https://justchenhao.github.io/LEVIR/
## LEVIR-CD is a new large-scale remote sensing Building Change Detection dataset. The introduced dataset would be a new benchmark for evaluating change detection (CD) algorithms, especially those based on deep learning.

# How to Run Code
### Just tack a shortcut of the data from the data on drive to your drive
