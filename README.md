# Hyperspectral Change-Detection-based-on-modification-of-UNet-neural-networks
## Abstract
### Earthâ€™s surface changes continuously due to several natural and humanmade
### factors. Efficient change detection (CD) is useful in monitoring and managing different situations. The recent rise in launched hyperspectral platforms provides a diversity of spectrum in addition to the spatial resolution required to meet recent civil application requirements. Traditional multispectral CD algorithms hardly cope with the complex nature of hyperspectral images and their high dimensionality. To overcome these limitations, a CD deep convolutional neural network (CNN) semantic segmentation-based workflow was proposed. The proposed workflow is composed of four main stages, namely preprocessing, training, testing, and evaluation. preprocessing is performed to overcome hyperspectral image noise and the high dimensionality problem. Data technics and training technics were used to handle  imbalanced classes problem.  Also, we evaluated the generality and performance of the original UNet model and four variants of UNet, namely residual UNet, attention UNet, and attention residual UNet. After this, I also want to discover more complex Unet architectures using more complex encoders So I used VGG-16, ResNet-34, ResNeXt-50-32x4d, TIMM-ResNeSt-26d, and TIMM-Res2Net-50 26w 4s. And evaluate their performance.

# Dataset: 
## https://justchenhao.github.io/LEVIR/
## LEVIR-CD is a new large-scale remote sensing Building Change Detection dataset. The introduced dataset would be a new benchmark for evaluating change detection (CD) algorithms, especially those based on deep learning.
